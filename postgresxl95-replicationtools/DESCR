This package provides the following PostgreSQL tools:
  - pg_archivecleanup
  - pg_standby

pg_standby supports creation of a "warm standby" database server.
It is designed to be a waiting restore_command, which is needed
to turn a standard archive recovery into a warm standby operation.

pg_archivecleanup is designed to cleanup an archive when used as
an archive_cleanup_command when running with standby_mode = on.
pg_archivecleanup can also be used as a standalone program to
clean WAL file archives.
